    <h1>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h1>
      <p>
        The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/blogs/trainers/francesco-cirillo">invented by Francesco Cirillo</a>. The technique involves working in 25-minute intervals (called a pomodoro) followed by short 5-minute breaks. To get the most out of the technique, it is best to focus on only one task during any single pomodoro and only do other tasks or distractions during the breaks. <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique">Cirillo has more information on the benefits of his technique on his website.</a>

    <h1>What is this app for?</h1>
      <p>
        This app is for people who want to automate the setting of the timer. It keeps track of how many pomodoros you've done, allowing you to focus solely on the task you need to be doing. There is no need to check on the timer because a sound and a notification will inform you if an interval has finished.
